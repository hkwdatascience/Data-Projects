# My Personal Projects

This is the repository for all of my personal projects involving data science and application development. 
Here, you can find codes from my past experience and any ongoing projects. 

I am currently a master of science candidate at the Health Data Science program at Harvard University. 
You can reach me at hongkaiwang@hsph.harvard.edu. I am happy to collaborate on data analytics projects and development of data-focused applications.
